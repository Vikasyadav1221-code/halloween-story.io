</head>
<body>

<h2>A. The Beginning</h2>
<p>The whispering grows louder as the friends continue down the hallway. Their flashlights flicker as if the house is messing with them. They come to a crossroads: a staircase leading upstairs and a door to the basement.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#B1">Go upstairs.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#B2">Enter the basement.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="B1">B1. Upstairs</h2>
<p>The stairs creak under their weight as they cautiously ascend. The upstairs landing is dusty, and old family portraits hang crooked on the walls. At the end of the hallway, a door is ajar, and behind it, a faint light flickers.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#C1">Enter the room with the flickering light.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#C2">Explore the other rooms first.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="B2">B2. The Basement</h2>
<p>The basement door opens with a loud groan. A musty smell hits them, and the steps are narrow and steep. The basement is dark, but their flashlights reveal old furniture covered in sheets and a strange, large chest sitting in the corner.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#C3">Open the chest.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#C4">Look around the basement for clues first.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="C1">C1. The Flickering Light Room</h2>
<p>Inside the room, they find an old desk covered in cobwebs. The light is coming from a small, flickering candle. As they approach the desk, they notice an old book lying open. Its pages seem to be filled with strange symbols, and just as they try to read it, the door behind them slams shut.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#D1">Read from the book.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#D2">Try to find a way out of the room.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="C2">C2. Exploring Other Rooms</h2>
<p>They decide to check the other rooms first. One room has a broken mirror, and as they walk past it, they see their reflections move on their own. Another room seems to have an eerie whisper coming from behind the walls. They begin to feel as if they’re being watched.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#D3">Investigate the whispering.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#D1">Return to the flickering light room.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="C3">C3. The Chest</h2>
<p>The chest is old and rusted, but it opens with a creak. Inside, they find an old doll dressed in what looks like Victorian clothing. Its eyes are wide and glassy, and as they pick it up, they hear a soft giggle coming from behind them.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#D4">Keep the doll and explore the basement further.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#D5">Put the doll back and leave the basement.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="C4">C4. Basement Clues</h2>
<p>They search around the basement and find an old, dusty journal on one of the shelves. The journal tells the story of the house’s previous owners and how strange things began to happen after they found a mysterious object buried in the backyard.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#D6">Take the journal and leave the basement.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#D7">Look for the object in the backyard.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="D1">D1. Reading the Book</h2>
<p>As they read from the book, the symbols seem to come to life. The candle flickers wildly, and suddenly, shadows begin to form around them. The air feels heavy, and they realize they may have unleashed something dark.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#E1">Close the book immediately and try to escape.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#E2">Continue reading.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="D2">D2. Trying to Escape</h2>
<p>They search the room for an exit but realize there’s no way out. The walls seem to be closing in on them, and the shadows grow darker. Just as they begin to panic, they hear a voice from the book: "There is only one way out."</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#E2">Open the book and follow the voice’s instructions.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#E3">Keep looking for a hidden door or window.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="D3">D3. Investigating the Whispering</h2>
<p>They follow the whispering sound and find a small crack in the wall. Behind it, there’s a hidden passage. The air is cold, and as they crawl through, they start to feel a strange presence, as if something is watching them closely.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#E4">Continue through the passage.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#E5">Go back to the main hallway.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="D4">D4. Keeping the Doll</h2>
<p>They decide to keep the doll, and as they explore further, they start hearing the sound of footsteps following them. The doll’s eyes seem to follow their every move, and suddenly, it speaks: "You shouldn’t have taken me."</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#E6">Drop the doll and run.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#E7">Ask the doll what it wants.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="D5">D5. Putting the Doll Back</h2>
<p>They put the doll back in the chest, but as they turn to leave, the basement door slams shut. They hear the giggle again, this time louder. The chest opens by itself, and the doll is gone.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#E8">Look for the doll.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#E9">Try to escape the basement.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="D6">D6. Taking the Journal</h2>
<p>They take the journal and leave the basement. Upstairs, they begin reading more of the journal, which warns about a curse placed on the house. The last entry mentions something about the clock striking midnight.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#F1">Investigate the clock in the hallway.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#F2">Continue reading the journal.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="D7">D7. Finding the Object</h2>
<p>They head outside to the backyard, where they find a small patch of disturbed earth. As they begin to dig, they uncover a strange, glowing object. It pulses with energy, and the ground around them begins to shake.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#F3">Take the object inside.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#F4">Leave the object and go back inside.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="E1">E1. Escaping</h2>
<p>They close the book and dash toward the door, but it won’t open. The shadows start to move faster, creeping closer. They realize that the only way out is to destroy the book.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#G1">Burn the book.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#G2">Tear the book apart.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="E2">E2. Continuing to Read</h2>
<p>As they continue reading, the shadows take shape. Figures from the past begin to materialize, walking toward them. The room begins to spin, and they hear whispers all around them. The only thing they can do is keep reading and hope for the best.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#G3">Trust the book and keep reading.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#G4">Stop reading and try to escape.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="E3">E3. Hidden Door</h2>
<p>They find a small hidden door behind a dusty curtain. When they open it, they find a narrow staircase leading down to a secret underground tunnel. The tunnel is dark, and the air is damp.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#F5">Go down the tunnel.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#F6">Stay in the room and look for another exit.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="E4">E4. Mirror Room</h2>
<p>The passage leads them into a strange room with walls covered in mirrors. Every reflection seems to show a different version of them, older, younger, or even wearing different clothes. Suddenly, the reflections begin to move on their own.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#F7">Break one of the mirrors.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#F8">Try to find a way out without touching the mirrors.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="E5">E5. Back to the Hallway</h2>
<p>They decide to go back to the main hallway, but everything seems different now. The doors are closed, and the air feels heavier. Just as they start to feel lost, they hear footsteps behind them.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#F9">Follow the footsteps.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#F10">Run to the front door.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="F1">F1. Investigating the Clock</h2>
<p>The clock in the hallway is tall and old. It’s about to strike midnight, and as the minute hand moves, they hear a low groan from inside the clock. When it strikes twelve, the front of the clock opens, revealing a hidden compartment.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#G5">Enter the compartment.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#G6">Close the clock and run.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="F2">F2. Reading the Journal</h2>
<p>The journal tells of a ritual that the previous owners performed to try and stop the curse. However, it didn’t work, and instead, it trapped their spirits inside the house. The only way to break the curse is to finish the ritual before midnight.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#G7">Perform the ritual.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#G8">Ignore the ritual and leave the house.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="F3">F3. Taking the Object Inside</h2>
<p>The object in the backyard is warm to the touch. As they take it inside, it begins to glow brighter. The house starts to shake, and they hear a deep voice from the walls, demanding they return the object.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#G9">Return the object to the backyard.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#G10">Keep the object and confront the voice.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="F4">F4. Leaving the Object</h2>
<p>They leave the object in the backyard and go back inside. However, things seem different. The walls are shifting, and they hear strange voices calling their names. It feels like the house itself is alive and aware of them now.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#G11">Try to escape the house.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#G12">Search the house for the source of the voices.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="G1">G1. Ending: Escaped</h2>
<p>They burn the book, and the shadows vanish. The air clears, and they find the door unlocked. They leave the house safely, but they know they’ll never forget that night.</p>

<h2 id="G2">G2. Ending: Trapped in the House</h2>
<p>They tear the book apart, but the shadows grow stronger. The walls close in on them, and they realize it’s too late.</p>

<h2 id="G3">G3. Ending: Freed the Spirits</h2>
<p>By continuing to read, they summon the spirits of the house’s former residents. The spirits, grateful to be freed, allow them to leave unharmed.</p>

<h2 id="G4">G4. Ending: Cursed to Stay</h2>
<p>They stop reading, but the shadows overpower them, trapping them in the room forever.</p>

<h2 id="G5">G5. Ending: Found the Secret Escape</h2>
<p>Inside the clock compartment, they find a hidden exit that leads them out of the house, safe and sound.</p>

<h2 id="G6">G6. Ending: Lost in the House</h2>
<p>They run, but the house doesn’t let them go. The door vanishes, and they’re trapped.</p>

<h2 id="G7">G7. Ending: Lifted the Curse</h2>
<p>They perform the ritual, and the curse is lifted. The spirits of the house thank them before disappearing, leaving the house quiet.</p>

<h2 id="G8">G8. Ending: Consumed by the Curse</h2>
<p>They ignore the ritual, but the house’s curse takes hold of them, and they’re never seen again.</p>

<h2 id="G9">G9. Ending: Escaped by Returning the Object</h2>
<p>They return the object, and the house stops shaking. The voice fades, and they’re able to leave the house safely.</p>

<h2 id="G10">G10. Ending: Sacrificed to the Spirit</h2>

<h2 id="G11">G11. Ending: Escaped but Haunted</h2>
<p>They manage to escape the house, but the memory of the voices and the house’s power haunts them forever.</p>
